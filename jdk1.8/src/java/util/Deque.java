/**
 * deque 双端队列
 *
 * A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. 在两端支持元素插入和移除的线性集合。
 *
 * The name deque is short for "double ended queue" and is usually pronounced "deck". deque是“双端队列”的缩写，通常发音为“deck”。
 * Most Deque implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.
 * 大多数Deque实现对可能包含的元素数量没有固定的限制，但是这个接口支持容量限制的Deque以及没有固定大小限制的Deque
 *
 * This interface defines methods to access the elements at both ends of the deque. 这个接口定义了访问deque容器两端元素的方法
 * Methods are provided to insert, remove, and examine the element. 提供了插入、删除和检查元素的方法
 * Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation).
 * 这些方法都以两种形式存在:一个在操作失败时抛出异常，另一个返回一个特殊值(null或false，取决于操作)
 *
 * The latter form of the insert operation is designed specifically for use with capacity-rsestricted Deque implementations; 后一种形式的插入操作是专门为容量受限的Deque实现而设计的
 *
 * in most implementations, insert operations cannot fail. 在大多数实现中，插入操作不会失败
 *
 * The twelve methods described above are summarized in the following table:
 * Summary of Deque methods
 *
 *    <td><b>Insert</b></td>
 *
 *    <td>{@link Deque#addFirst addFirst(e)}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#offerFirst offerFirst(e)}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#addLast addLast(e)}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#offerLast offerLast(e)}</td>
 *
 *    <td><b>Remove</b></td>
 *
 *    <td>{@link Deque#removeFirst removeFirst()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#pollFirst pollFirst()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#removeLast removeLast()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#pollLast pollLast()}</td>
 *
 *    <td><b>Examine</b></td>
 *
 *    <td>{@link Deque#getFirst getFirst()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#peekFirst peekFirst()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#getLast getLast()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link Deque#peekLast peekLast()}</td>
 *
 * This interface extends the Queue interface.
 * When a deque is used as a queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results.
 * Elements are added at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning.
 * The methods inherited from the Queue interface are precisely equivalent to Deque methods as indicated in the following table:
 * 继承自Queue接口的方法与Deque方法完全等价，如下表所示
 *
 * Comparison of Queue and Deque methods
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link java.util.Queue#add add(e)}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #addLast addLast(e)}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link java.util.Queue#offer offer(e)}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #offerLast offerLast(e)}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link java.util.Queue#remove remove()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #removeFirst removeFirst()}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link java.util.Queue#poll poll()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #pollFirst pollFirst()}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link java.util.Queue#element element()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #getFirst getFirst()}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link java.util.Queue#peek peek()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #peek peekFirst()}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *
 * Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks.
 * This interface should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class.
 * When a deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the beginning of the deque.
 * Stack methods are precisely equivalent to Deque methods as indicated in the table below:
 *
 * Comparison of Stack and Deque methods
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link #push push(e)}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #addFirst addFirst(e)}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link #pop pop()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #removeFirst removeFirst()}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td>{@link #peek peek()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #peekFirst peekFirst()}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *
 * Note that the peek method works equally well when a deque is used as a queue or a stack;
 * in either case, elements are drawn from the beginning of the deque.
 *
 * This interface provides two methods to remove interior elements, removeFirstOccurrence and removeLastOccurrence.
 *
 * Unlike the List interface, this interface does not provide support for indexed access to elements.
 *
 * While Deque implementations are not strictly required to prohibit the insertion of null elements, they are strongly encouraged to do so.
 * Users of any e Deque implementations that do allow null elements are strongly encouraged not to take advantage of the ability to insert nulls.
 * This is so because null is used as a special return value by various methods to indicated that the deque is empty.
 *
 * Deque implementations generally do not define element-based versions of the  equals and  hashCode methods, but instead inherit the identity-based versions from class Object.
 *
 * This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.
